# Sea Level Predictor

This repository contains scripts and data to visualize and predict sea level rise based on historical data.

Project Overview
The Sea Level Predictor project aims to analyze and visualize historical sea level data using Python. It includes scripts to create visualizations such as scatter plots with linear regression and predictions for future sea levels.

Data
The primary dataset used for this project is epa-sea-level.csv, which contains historical sea level measurements.

Requirements
To run the scripts in this repository, you need:

Python 3
Pandas
Matplotlib
NumPy
SciPy
Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy scipy
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/poorvashetye/Sea-Level-Predictor.git
cd Sea-Level-Predictor
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python sea_level_predictor.py
View the generated plots:

The script will generate scatter plots with linear regression and save them as sea_level_plot.png.
